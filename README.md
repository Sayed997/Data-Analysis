## Data Analysis and Predictive Analytics Projects
This Folder contains two projects prepared while enrolled in the Big Data Analytics Course at York University. Python and Jupyter Notebooks were used to complete the projects

#### Project 1 
Predicting House Prices using Linear Regression and Random Forest
This project follows the full Data Analysis process and concludes by applying 2 different machine learning models. The output or target variable was continuous so analysis was done with the goal of applying a regression-based model.

The Data set was sourced from Kaggle. [Link here](https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market)

#### Project 2
Predicting Customer Churn with Logistic Regression
This project follows the full Data Analysis process and concludes by applying Logistic Regression to solve the posed Classification problem.
